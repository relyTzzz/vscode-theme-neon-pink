# Neon Green Theme Collection

15 VS Code themes in 9 families — vivid **Neon Green**, hot-pink **Neon Pink**, warm **Soft Glow**, minimal **OpenCode**, golden **Hermes Agent**, purple **Aura**, slate **Omarchy**, retro **Synthwave '84**, and clean **Zed** — built for developers who want their editor to feel sharp, comfortable, and unmistakably alive.

> Eight aesthetics, one collection. Neon Green for electric terminal energy. Soft Glow for warm, eye-friendly coding. OpenCode for a minimal flat-black canvas. Hermes Agent for gold-on-navy warmth. Aura for purple haze. Omarchy for slate minimalism. Synthwave '84 for retro neon. Zed for clean neutrality. All tuned for long sessions.

## Why this theme exists

Most themes choose one of two extremes:

- visually loud, but tiring after an hour
- safe and readable, but forgettable

**Neon Green Theme Collection** offers eight approaches:

- **Neon Green** — bold, electric identity with a dark terminal aesthetic
- **Soft Glow** — warm, desaturated tones that never tire your eyes
- **OpenCode** — minimal flat near-black with a warm peach accent and purple keywords
- **Hermes Agent** — warm gold-on-navy with cornsilk text
- **Aura** — deep purple-black with violet keywords and mint types
- **Omarchy** — slate minimalism with neon green strings and cyan keywords
- **Synthwave '84** — retro outrun neon on purple dusk
- **Zed** — clean neutral palette in dark and light variants
- All with clear syntax separation and enough contrast for real work
- All tuned for long coding sessions in any lighting

## iTerm2 terminal themes

Use the Neon Green palette in your terminal too. Matching iTerm2 color profiles are included in the repo:

- **Neon Green Dark** — deep midnight background (`#0b0b16`) with neon green (`#39ff14`) cursor and accents
- **Neon Green Light** — mint-green background (`#e2f5e3`) with green accents

Download: [Dark](https://github.com/luongnv89/vscode-theme-neon-green/raw/main/themes/Neon%20Green%20Dark.itermcolors) · [Light](https://github.com/luongnv89/vscode-theme-neon-green/raw/main/themes/Neon%20Green%20Light.itermcolors)

### Install in iTerm2 (manual)

1. Download the `.itermcolors` file(s) from the links above (or clone the repo).
2. Open **iTerm2 → Settings** (`⌘,`), then go to **Profiles → Colors**.
3. Click the **Color Presets…** dropdown at the bottom right and choose **Import…**.
4. Pick the downloaded `.itermcolors` file and confirm.
5. Open **Color Presets…** again and select the imported preset (e.g. *Neon Green Dark*) to apply it.
6. Repeat for every iTerm2 profile you want themed.

Double-clicking the file in Finder also imports it, but the manual route lets you target the exact profile you want.

## Warp terminal themes

Eight Warp themes ship alongside the editor themes — one per variant. YAML files live in [`themes/warp/`](https://github.com/luongnv89/vscode-theme-neon-green/tree/main/themes/warp).

![Warp showing all six Neon Green and Soft Glow themes in the Themes picker](../assets/warp-themes-preview.png)

Download: [Dark](https://github.com/luongnv89/vscode-theme-neon-green/raw/main/themes/warp/neon-green-dark.yaml) · [Midnight](https://github.com/luongnv89/vscode-theme-neon-green/raw/main/themes/warp/neon-green-midnight.yaml) · [Liquid Glass](https://github.com/luongnv89/vscode-theme-neon-green/raw/main/themes/warp/neon-green-liquid-glass.yaml) · [Light](https://github.com/luongnv89/vscode-theme-neon-green/raw/main/themes/warp/neon-green-light.yaml) · [Soft Glow Dark](https://github.com/luongnv89/vscode-theme-neon-green/raw/main/themes/warp/soft-glow-dark.yaml) · [Soft Glow Light](https://github.com/luongnv89/vscode-theme-neon-green/raw/main/themes/warp/soft-glow-light.yaml) · [OpenCode Dark](https://github.com/luongnv89/vscode-theme-neon-green/raw/main/themes/warp/opencode.yaml)

### Install in Warp

Warp loads custom themes from `~/.warp/themes/`. Copy the YAML files there and they show up in the theme picker.

1. Clone the repo, or download individual YAML files from the links above.
2. Create the themes directory (if needed) and copy the files:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.warp/themes
   cp themes/warp/*.yaml ~/.warp/themes/
   ```

   Only want one variant? Copy a single file instead, e.g. `cp themes/warp/neon-green-dark.yaml ~/.warp/themes/`.
3. Open **Warp → Settings** (`⌘,`) → **Appearance**.
4. In the **Themes** list pick one of: **Neon Green Dark**, **Neon Green Midnight**, **Neon Green Liquid Glass**, **Neon Green Light**, **Soft Glow Dark**, **Soft Glow Light**, or **OpenCode Dark**.
5. The theme applies instantly. If the list doesn't refresh, close and reopen the Settings window — no Warp restart needed.

Uninstall: delete the YAML files from `~/.warp/themes/` and pick a built-in Warp theme.
